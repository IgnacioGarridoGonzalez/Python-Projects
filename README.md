# Python-Projects

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on in Python.
I leave a description of each of them and instructions on how to compile them when necessary:

I.  GeoApp:

  This program takes the latitude and longitude of a given point on the surface of the Earth and returns the closest world capital and the ditance to it in kilometers. 
  In order to compile it it is necessary to provide the path to the file 'concap.csv' (also provided in the repository and found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/nikitagrec/world-capitals-gps), which contains the latitude and longitude of all the state capitals in the world.

II. Great Circle Distance Finder:

  This program takes the latitude and longitude of two point on the surface of the Earth and returns the distance between them in kilometers.
